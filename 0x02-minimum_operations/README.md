# Fewest Number of Operations to Reach n H Characters

## Problem Description
In a text file, there is initially a single character **H**. Your text editor can execute only two operations on this file: **Copy All** and **Paste**.

Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` **H** characters in the file.

### Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n)
